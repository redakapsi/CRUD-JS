🛒 Product Management App

This app is a simple product management system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete product entries while storing data in the browser’s localStorage so that it persists even after refreshing or closing the page.

✨ Features

Dark Mode / Light Mode Toggle 🌙☀️
Switch between dark and light themes with a single click.

Add New Products ➕
Enter product details like Title, Category, Price, Taxes, and Ads.

If you set a count > 1, the product will be duplicated multiple times.

Auto Calculation 🧮
Shows the total price (Price + Taxes + Ads) dynamically as you type.

Display Products 📋
Products are displayed in a table with:

Serial number

Title

Category

Price, Taxes, Ads

Calculated total

Update and Delete options

Delete Options 🗑️

Delete single product: Remove one row.

Delete All: Clear all products at once. The button only appears when there is data, and disappears when the list is empty.

Local Storage 💾
All products are saved in the browser’s storage, so they stay even after refreshing the page.

🚀 Possible Improvements (future features)

Add Update/Edit function to modify existing product data.

Add search by title or category.

Add sorting & filtering (e.g., by price or category).

Add export/import feature for saving products as a file.(already added still only import);

👉 In short, this app is like a mini inventory manager or CRUD system (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products, with a clean UI and dark/light mode support.
